# Enigma-2205  

 This project was a struggle for me.  As such most of it is incomplete except  
 for the processor class.  That was the class that I setup to do a majority  
 of the heavy lifting.  The keys, offsets and shifts are all calculated there.  

My evaluation is as follows:  
Functionality - Well Below Expectations. Does not have the required number of  
                classes successfully implemented.  

Object Oriented Programming - Below Expectations. Project may have too many  
of too few classes, or include knowledge/information/behavior that isnt 
necessary for a given class to know.  

Ruby Conventions - Meets Expectations. Code is mostly properly indented,  
                  spaced and lines are not excessively long.  

Test Driven Development - Meets Expectations. Tests are written before   
                          implementing code.  All methods are tested.  

Version Control - Below Expectations - Less than 20 commits due to the nature  
                  of the amount of the project finished.
